EVTTITLE_RTK.130000;Rise of the Yellow Turbans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130000;All across the empire, peasants and disenfranchised officials have risen up against the Han Empire. They come adorned with yellow turbans around their heads, arms, and necks. The empire has been thrown into crisis.\n\n As long as the Yellow Turbans exist, more and more people will use their cause as an excuse to rebel as well. If not extinguished quickly, this could very well spell the end of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130001;Rise of the Liang Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130001;Local Liang provincial leaders have taken advantage of the Qiang and Di raids to start a major rebellion. This rebellion threatens to sweep all of Liang away from the Empire's clutches...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130002;Confrontation with the Yellow Gates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130002;The power held by the corrupt Ten Eunuchs has grown too much for the loyalists at court. With the death of Emperor Ling of the Han Dynasty, the eunuchs have set up a new emperor as their puppet. With the armies of the loyalists preparing to fight the Ten Eunuchs and the Yellow Gates, an elite army established by the Emperor as a counter to the growing power of He Jin. The coming battle inside the Yellow Gates will surely affect all under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTTITLE_RTK.130008;Devil in Luoyang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130008;Dong Zhuo's abrupt arrival at the capital sent the eunuchs into flight. Their forces were scattered while He Jin's army was absorbed into Dong Zhuo's forces. He now controls the Emperor, the court, and the largest military in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTTITLE_RTK.130009;Balance of Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130009;The scales of power have been weighed in our favor. As such, the other lords of the realm eye our domain with jealousy and greed. They plot and convene against us. At any moment, they could sally against us. We must prepare for their eventual assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTTITLE_RTK.130014;Coalition Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130014;The Heavens have cursed the grand coalition. The coalition has fallen apart from internal strife while their enemy remains safely in power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RTK.130019;The rebels have annhilated us in the field and captured much of our territory. We have no other choice than to surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130020;Dong Zhuo Retreats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130020;The vile Dong Zhuo has been beaten. His forces have withdrawn into the west, abandoning Luoyang and all lands east of Changan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130021;Dong Zhuo Survives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_RTK.130021;The court has settled into Changan. Dong Zhuo has taken the Emperor to the Western capital. What can we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_RTK.130021;We have managed to escape the rebels and establish ourselves in the ancient capital of Changan. Maybe we can have some peace now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_RTK.130021;Some commotion has taken place in the Han Imperial Court. Perhaps now is a good time to attack?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_RTK.130026;Chaos in Changan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130026;When Dong Zhuo died, his generals and armies fled. They eventually returned hoping for amnesty, but Wang Yun was either too proud or too dogmatic to accept them. So the generals invaded, slew Wang Yun and his family, and put Lü Bu to flight. The shadow of Dong Zhuo hangs over the Empire once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130027;Wrath of Cao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130027;The warlord Cao Cao has called for vengeance against Tao Qian. It seems Tao Qian tasked his man Zhang Kai to escort Cao Cao's father Cao Song through Xu. Instead, Zhang Kai slew Cao Song, stole his valuables, and fled. Cao Cao swears Tao Qian will pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130028;The Rise of Lü Bu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_RTK.130029;The Rise of Liu Bei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RTK.130031;The world breathed a sigh of relief when Dong Zhuo was felled.

EVTTITLE_RTK.130032;Imperial Escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130032;Through Heavenly fate, the Emperor and much of his entourage have managed to escape the chaos of Changan. Li Jue and Guo Si seem to have temporarily set their differences aside while they attempt to hunt the Emperor back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130033;The Rise of Cao Cao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130033;Though many spoke of loyalty, it was Cao Cao who reached out and saved the Emperor. Cao Cao now controls the Son of Heaven. His ambitions are known, and the whole world fears his judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130034;Liu Bei's Kindness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130034;Lü Bu's takeover of Yan was completely undone within a few years. Once again without a land to call home, Lü Bu eagerly accepted Liu Bei's kindness in the form of the county of Xiao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130035;Lü Bu's Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130035;While Liu Bei was out campaigning, Lü Bu used a pretext to takeover Liu Bei's territory. Once Liu Bei returned, Lü Bu granted the former the county of Xiao... As repayment for Liu Bei's previous kindness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RTK.130040;End of the Yellow Turbans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RTK.130040;Even though bandits and rebels still periodically stir up trouble in the land. They no longer proclaim themselves as furthering the creation of a yellow heaven. The Yellow Turban rebellion is finally over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
